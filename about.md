# ABOUT

## My research

*Human health and disease; artificial intelligence; computation for social good; the microbial ecology of the human body; genetics, genomics, and evolution; the art and science of data visualization.*

I am a Master's Candidate, Interdisciplinary Innovation Fellow, and Reproducible Research Fellow in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science. Prior to joining Penn Engineering, I was a life science professional with experience in molecular genetics and public health research. I am currently a Computational Researcher with the <a href="https://delafuentelab.seas.upenn.edu/" style="color: rgb(167,55,75)" target="_blank"><font color="A7374B">Machine Biology Group</font></a> at Penn Bioengineering and the Perelman School of Medicine.

The Machine Biology Group integrates synthetic biology, automation, and artificial intelligence to computerize biological systems, build synthetic molecular tools, and devise novel therapies. To support my current research, I was awarded a 2020 GAPSA-Provost Fellowship in Interdisciplinary Innovation for the project *Deep learning to predict peptide antimicrobial activity for computer-guided antibiotic design.*

For the 2020â€“2021 academic year, I will serve as a Frictionless Data Reproducible Research Fellow for the <a href="https://okfn.org" style="color: rgb(167,55,75)" target="_blank"><font color="A7374B">Open Knowledge Foundation</font></a>, funded by the <a href="https://sloan.org" style="color: rgb(167,55,75)" target="_blank"><font color="A7374B">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</font></a>.

I am proficient in ```Java```, ```R```, and ```LaTeX```, and am actively learning ```C```, ```Python```, ```JavaScript```, and ```Bash```. Currently, I program daily in ```Python``` and weekly in ```R``` and ```Java```.

## This website

This website is intended to serve as a personal portfolio. It was developed in GitHub Pages as an homage to the excellence of Markdown. The ```JS D3``` visualization on my homepage is inspired by Lissajous curves and the movements of deep sea organisms.

Latest update: July 2020.

## My motivations

My research is motivated by a commitment to technological development, biomedical and otherwise, that is egalitarian and liberatory and not guided by profit-driven, discriminatory, and anti-environmentalist impulses.

```r
All Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace
Richard Brautigan | 1967

I like to think (and
the sooner the better!)
of a cybernetic meadow
where mammals and computers
live together in mutually
programming harmony
like pure water
touching clear sky.

I like to think
(right now, please!)
of a cybernetic forest
filled with pines and electronics
where deer stroll peacefully
past computers
as if they were flowers
with spinning blossoms.

I like to think
(it has to be!)
of a cybernetic ecology
where we are free of our labors
and joined back to nature,
returned to our mammal
brothers and sisters,
and all watched over
by machines of loving grace.
